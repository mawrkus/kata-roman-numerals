## Your Task

Write a method String convert(int) that takes a number and converts it to the according String representation.

Examples:

```
   1 ➔ I
   2 ➔ II
   3 ➔ III
   4 ➔ IV
   5 ➔ V
   9 ➔ IX
  21 ➔ XXI
  50 ➔ L
 100 ➔ C
 500 ➔ D
1000 ➔ M
```

## Hint

This kata lures a lot of people to implement features in the order of the numbers. But do not forget that it’s sometimes easier to start with a general case and add exceptions later.
